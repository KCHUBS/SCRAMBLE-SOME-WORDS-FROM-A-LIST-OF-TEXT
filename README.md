REDACTR - SCRAMBLE SOME WORDS FROM A BODY OF TEXT CONTENT

Scenario:
Your app is to help people safely share content on social media by scrambling portions of the text they don’t want the world to read/see. A user will write/paste some content into a form field and then specify the words that must be scrambled (using another field). Note that the user can specify more than one word (separated by space) to be scrambled.

Outcome:
After clicking a “Redact Now” button, the app scans through the original text and replaces the specified words to be scrambled with asterisks (i.e ****)
